Goals for this API.

    * Create, new API Users - API users in what sense? Users for the laravel app, or for Magento API? The latter is not possible via soap and must be done in Magento.
    * Each API User, Can Create Magento Customers.
    * Create and Associate Devices to Said Magento Customers - what is a Device?

So the structure for our existing wholesale partners is this:

    Parent Company -> Reseller -> End Customer.
    The two parent companies we currently work with are O'Rourke and Leopard.
    Each parent company has a number of child stores and locations.
    IE. Store 22 at Buddy Rents, Store 67, Store 176 etc..
    Each store sells the individual protection to the end customer.
    However, what we store on our end, is not the end customers information but the Wholesale Reseller's information.
    So we won't get an order from John Mathews, instead it will be Store 176 at Buddy Rents.
    I am attaching some of their more recent csv's they've sent over. - can we get those?

Right now our primary focus is to be able to utilize the bulk upload front-end interface of the API. So when we upload the CSV they've sent us...
We check if the customers exist already, if they don't, create them and associate them to the right user group. Leopard Or O'Rourke.
If the customer doesn't exist we will also need to create a new policy, our wholesale resellers use the normal policy.
In simple terms they are a individual customer but with a lot of devices. - what is a policy?
From there, check for a product sku, make sure we can find and match the product sku.
(this is often incorrect, we have some basic rules where we try to automatically correct and match). - what are the rules?
If we can find a matching sku, we go ahead and create the device and associate it to the customer. - is this done in Magento or in Laravel app?
Once the bulk upload is complete it should send an email confirmation to the API user, and generate an invoice,
list the number of devices created, how many if any failed and the order total etc. - Email sent to API user, not to wholesale customer? Invoice is one for Magento order, or entirely different thing?

That's the very basic jist of this, I figured once you had it up and installed locally you would have more questions.

Somethings to note, I believe the database file is missing in there you set DB's using the .env file system, I am not sure if its in there or not.
If you need help configuring that reach out and I will. I know we originally had this pinging a live development site
that's not quite up to the latest version of the life site, so we may need to do a new deployment of a development server
if you experience any oddities. Also we may need to set a different mysql password on that database, I've recently
changed all of the passwords and I am not sure that repo is current.
================================

So based on my discussion they think this is about 90% completed. I have attached the code base that is completed so
far.. we can discuss more on Skype about questions you may have.
